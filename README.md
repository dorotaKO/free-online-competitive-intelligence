<h1> open source intelligence tools for various internet investigations</h1>
<p>Rather than go into how you do online competitive intelligence, I&rsquo;m just going to run through a free list of tools that have earned themselves and honorable mention here and give you some awesome tidbits for finding information online.</p>
<p>I review competitive information on a daily basis; I have to warn you that its a lot of information.</p>

<h3><strong>Google Tools</strong></h3>
<p>You can&rsquo;t beat Google when it comes to free information and tons of data. The biggest issue with using Google effectively is understanding how to sift through massive volumes of data to find actionable nuggets of wisdom. To help you do that I&rsquo;ve include two link to a advanced search parameter cheat sheet and a walk-through of using advanced parameters. If you have a few minutes, you can also watch this official&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/landing/powersearching.html">Google training video on advanced search parameters</a>.</p>
